# Public Sub UDF_basic (Optional F As Fantastic = "Start of a new repository")

A series of personal vba Function (in future compatibile with VB.Net)

intro: If I'm doing something wrong please be patient (it's stupid to say but this is my first repository)
if your_state = "not in a good mood" Then Exit README

On this project I want to collect (and create or adjust) a series of vba UDF 'https://www.google.com/search?q=UDF+vba

I have no idea where this repository gonna take me but I fill free to start just for fun.
Hoping to learn better and get part of the GitHub community actively.
